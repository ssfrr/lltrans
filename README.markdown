lltrans : An anything-to-C translator
=====================================

Built on decades of machine learning and AI research, lltrans is an
advanced new tool capable of translating any program [1] into highly
efficient, portable C code. lltrans reads any given file (or stdin), and
intelligently learns and parses the input language.

[1] caveat - currently lltrans only works for programs that print
"LinkedList NYC" to stdout
